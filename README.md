# Lousy Liquids
A simpleish plugin to add lousy liquid handling to **[SerenityJS](https://github.com/SerenityJS/serenity)**.<br>
At the moment, this plugin only replicates a basic level of vanilla fluid handling mechanics, hence 'lousy'.

In some cases, though, this is more than enough. You can also use it to customize liquid interaction to create ore generators.

It's also worth mentioning that the methods are dynamic, so you can add your own liquids by supplementing your own block identifiers to all type specifications.
